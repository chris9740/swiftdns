# Project assets

This directory includes assets that are used during installation. This includes the default config file, systemd files, project metadata, and a preset of recommended blacklists.

The domains used in the blacklists were gathered from [netify.ai](https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications) and can be found inside of the `filters/` directory.

To apply any of these lists, copy them into the root of `/etc/swiftdns/filters/`.
