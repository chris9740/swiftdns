This directory contains a set of recommended blacklists to block some of the most common privacy-violating websites, such as Google (including DoubleClick), Tiktok, among others.

The domains used in the blacklists were gathered from [netify.ai](https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications) and can be found inside of the `filters/` directory.

To apply any of these lists, copy them into the root of `/etc/swiftdns/filters/`.
